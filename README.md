# Publicly Open Mapping Files

POMF is a set of open, unencumbered Minecraft mappings, free for everyone to use under the Creative Commons Zero license.

The current version targets Minecraft version **16w32b**.

## Contributing

Compile Enigma from [here](https://github.com/OpenModLoader/Enigma) using Gradle and run it from build/libs.

Please remember that copying and pasting mappings from alternate projects under more restrictive licenses (such as MCP) is **completely forbidden**. It is also good to consult name changes with other people via pull requests.

**NOTE:** The current version of OML's Enigma has a bug where it won't save mappings for unnamed classes. In that case, rename them to something like 
"unnamed/axy" if the class name is "axy".
