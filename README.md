Compile Enigma from [here](https://github.com/OpenModLoader/Enigma) using Gradle and run it from build/libs.

**NOTE:** The current version of OML's Enigma has a bug where it won't save mappings for unnamed classes. In that case, rename them to something like 
"unnamed/axy" if the class name is "axy".
