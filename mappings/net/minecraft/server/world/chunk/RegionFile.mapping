	FIELD field_1618 BLOCK_BUFFER [B
		COMMENT Unused buffer to store a single 4KB block of memory.
	FIELD field_1619 file Ljava/io/File;
	FIELD field_1620 randomAccessFile Ljava/io/RandomAccessFile;
	FIELD field_1621 chunkBlockInfo [I
		COMMENT Contains the block offset and number of blocks that each chunk occupies. If a
		COMMENT chunk does not store any data, then the array entry contains zero. The format
		COMMENT of a non-zero entry in the array is as follows:
		COMMENT <ul>
		COMMENT     <li>bits[0:7] , the number of blocks that the chunk data occupies</li>
		COMMENT     <li>bits[8:31], the block offset of the first byte in the chunk data</li>
		COMMENT </ul>
		COMMENT The above is specified in lsb first. This array is also written to the region
		COMMENT file starting at byte 0.
	FIELD field_1622 chunkSaveTimes [I
		COMMENT Contains the times for the latest modification to each chunk. This array
		COMMENT is also written to the region file starting at byte 4096 (block offset 1).
	FIELD field_1624 bytesWritten I
		COMMENT The total number of bytes written to the region file, since this {@code RegionFile}
		COMMENT object was instantiated. Note that this is always a multiple of 4096 (the size
		COMMENT of a single 4KB block).
	FIELD field_1625 lastModifiedTime J
	FIELD field_9606 blockEmptyFlags Ljava/util/ArrayList;
		COMMENT A list containing flags for each of the 4KB blocks in the file indicating whether
		COMMENT it should be considered empty or occupied. In particular, if a value at index
		COMMENT {@code blockOffset} is {@code true} then it is empty, and otherwise occupied.
